# Newsletter Subscription Form 
This is a simple JavaScript code that validates an email input and subscribes the user to a newsletter.
The code uses a regular expression to check if the email input matches the pattern of a valid email address.
If the email is invalid, an alert message will appear. If the email is valid, the input will be cleared and a success message will be displayed.
